# Liver Cirrhosis Patient Survival Prediction
Authors: Sunidhi Goyal

## Motivation
Liver cirrhosis is a life-threatening condition that affects millions of
individuals worldwide, presenting a significant public health challenge. This chronic
liver disease is characterized by the progressive scarring of the liver tissue, which
ultimately leads to liver failure if left untreated. Among the critical aspects of liver
cirrhosis is the unpredictability of patient survival, which depends on a myriad of
factors, including disease severity, comorbidities, treatment regimens, and individual
patient characteristics.

## Goals
- To predict the survivability estimates of patients with various medical data under purview.
- To study the impact of stage and drug groups that affect the survivability estimates of patients.
- To study how uncertainties inform survivability estimates.
- To evaluate the best-performing model using accuracy and information criteria.


## Data 
The data are from Kaggle. There are 1 response variable, and 19 predictor
variables originally, some of which might be dropped depending on their relevance to
our analysis.
